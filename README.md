## General Information

This workshop is intended to provide or refresh fundamental skills needed to conduct genomics research. It's target audience is researchers who have litle prior computational experience and its lessons are domain specific, building on learner's existing knowdledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems. 

The course is aimed at staff and students from TU Delft. **You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.**  

Participants must have acces to a computer with Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.). In case of having a windows system, make sure to have access to PuTTY or otherwise install it by going to the installation page.
